# Day 4 Content: Advanced Data Analysis Techniques

## Overview
Today, we dive into advanced data analysis techniques using Python. You will learn how to manipulate and analyze complex datasets, perform advanced data transformations, and apply statistical methods to uncover deeper insights. By the end of the day, you will be able to handle real-world data challenges with confidence.

## 1. Advanced Data Manipulation with Pandas
Pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis in Python. Today, you will learn advanced techniques for working with complex datasets.

### 1.1 Multi-Index DataFrames
Multi-Index DataFrames allow you to work with hierarchical data structures. You can use them to group and aggregate data across multiple dimensions.

### 1.2 Pivot Tables
Pivot tables are a powerful tool for summarizing and analyzing data. You can use them to aggregate data and create summary tables.

### 1.3 Merging and Joining DataFrames
Merging and joining DataFrames allow you to combine data from multiple sources. You will learn how to perform inner, outer, left, and right joins.

---

## 2. Advanced Data Transformations
### 2.1 GroupBy and Aggregation
The `groupby` function allows you to group data by one or more columns and apply aggregation functions like `sum`, `mean`, and `count`.

### 2.2 Applying Custom Functions
You can apply custom functions to DataFrames using the `apply` method. This allows you to perform complex transformations on your data.

### 2.3 Handling Missing Data
Missing data is a common issue in real-world datasets. You will learn how to handle missing data using techniques like imputation and interpolation.

## 3. Statistical Analysis
### 3.1 Descriptive Statistics
Descriptive statistics summarize the main features of a dataset. You will learn how to calculate measures like mean, median, and standard deviation.

### 3.2 Correlation Analysis
Correlation analysis helps you understand the relationship between variables. You will learn how to calculate correlation coefficients and interpret the results.

### 3.3 Hypothesis Testing
Hypothesis testing allows you to test assumptions about your data. You will learn how to perform t-tests and chi-square tests.

## 4. Practice Exercises
Today, you will work with three datasets to apply what you've learned. Each dataset is designed for specific practices:

### Dataset 1: Sales Data (`Dataset1.csv`)
- **Description**: Contains sales data with columns like `Region`, `Sales`, `Profit`, and `Quantity`.
- **Practices**: Practice 1, Practice 2.

### Dataset 2: Customer Feedback Data (`Dataset2.csv`)
- **Description**: Contains customer feedback scores and demographic information.
- **Practices**: Practice 3, Practice 4.

### Dataset 3: Product Performance Data (`Dataset3.csv`)
- **Description**: Contains product performance metrics like `Price`, `Sales`, and `Customer Rating`.
- **Practices**: Practice 5, Practice 6.

## 5. Practice Tasks
### Practice 1: GroupBy and Aggregation
- **Dataset**: `Dataset1.csv`
- **Task**: Group the data by `Region` and calculate the total `Sales` and `Profit` for each region.
- **Deliverable**: "Practice1_Analysis.csv"

### Practice 2: Pivot Tables
- **Dataset**: `Dataset1.csv`
- **Task**: Create a pivot table showing the average `Sales` and `Profit` by `Region` and `Quarter`.
- **Deliverable**: "Practice2_Analysis.csv"

### Practice 3: Handling Missing Data
- **Dataset**: `Dataset2.csv`
- **Task**: Identify and handle missing values in the `FeedbackScore` column using imputation.
- **Deliverable**: "Practice3_Analysis.csv"

### Practice 4: Correlation Analysis
- **Dataset**: `Dataset2.csv`
- **Task**: Calculate the correlation between `FeedbackScore` and `AgeGroup`.
- **Deliverable**: "Practice4_Analysis.csv"

### Practice 5: Hypothesis Testing
- **Dataset**: `Dataset3.csv`
- **Task**: Perform a t-test to compare the mean `Customer Rating` for products priced above and below $200.
- **Deliverable**: "Practice5_Analysis.csv"

### Practice 6: Creating Visualizations
- **Dataset**: `Dataset3.csv`
- **Task**: Create a scatter plot showing the relationship between `Price` and `Customer Rating`.
- **Deliverable**: "Practice6_Visualization.html"
