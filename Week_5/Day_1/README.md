# Day 1: Advanced Data Visualization with Python

## Overview
Today, we dive into advanced data visualization techniques using Python. You will learn how to create interactive visualizations using Plotly, a powerful library for creating dynamic and interactive charts. By the end of the day, you will be able to create sophisticated visualizations that can be used in presentations and reports.

---

## Objectives
- Learn the basics of Plotly and its key features.
- Create interactive visualizations such as scatter plots, bar charts, and line charts.
- Customize visualizations with annotations, hover effects, and themes.
- Export visualizations for use in reports and presentations.

---

## Tasks
1. Read **Content.md** for a comprehensive introduction to advanced data visualization with Python.
2. Complete **Practice1.md** through **Practice6.md** to apply what you've learned.
3. Use the provided datasets to create interactive visualizations.

---

## Deliverables
- Submit visualizations for each practice task.
- Save your files as:
  - "Practice1_Visualization.html"
  - "Practice2_Visualization.html"
  - "Practice3_Visualization.html"
  - "Practice4_Visualization.html"
  - "Practice5_Visualization.html"
  - "Practice6_Visualization.html"
