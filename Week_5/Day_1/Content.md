# Day 1 Content: Advanced Data Visualization with Python

## Overview
Data visualization is a critical skill for data analysts, as it allows you to communicate insights effectively. Today, you will learn how to create advanced, interactive visualizations using **Plotly**, a Python library that enables you to build dynamic and engaging charts. By the end of the day, you will be able to create visualizations that can be used in presentations, dashboards, and reports.

## 1. Introduction to Plotly
Plotly is a powerful Python library for creating interactive visualizations. It supports a wide range of chart types, including scatter plots, bar charts, line charts, and more. Plotly visualizations are highly customizable and can be exported as HTML files, making them ideal for sharing.

### Key Features of Plotly:
- **Interactivity**: Hover effects, zooming, and panning.
- **Customization**: Annotations, themes, and color schemes.
- **Export Options**: Save visualizations as HTML, PNG, or PDF.

### Why Use Plotly?
- It allows you to create professional-quality visualizations with minimal code.
- It supports interactive features that make your charts more engaging.
- It integrates well with other Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy.

## 2. Creating Basic Visualizations with Plotly
### 2.1 Scatter Plots
Scatter plots are used to visualize the relationship between two numerical variables. In Plotly, you can create scatter plots with hover effects, annotations, and custom markers.

### 2.2 Bar Charts
Bar charts are ideal for comparing categorical data. Plotly allows you to create stacked bar charts, grouped bar charts, and horizontal bar charts.

### 2.3 Line Charts
Line charts are used to show trends over time. Plotly supports multiple lines, annotations, and custom line styles.

## 3. Customizing Visualizations
### 3.1 Adding Annotations
Annotations are text labels that can be added to charts to highlight specific data points or trends. Plotly allows you to customize the position, font, and color of annotations.

### 3.2 Hover Effects
Hover effects display additional information when the user hovers over a data point. Plotly allows you to customize the hover text and format.

### 3.3 Themes and Layouts
Plotly provides several built-in themes and layouts that can be used to customize the appearance of your charts. You can also create custom layouts to match your brand or presentation style.

## 4. Exporting Visualizations
Plotly visualizations can be exported as HTML files, which can be embedded in websites or shared as standalone files. You can also export visualizations as static images (PNG, JPEG) or PDFs for use in reports.

## 5. Practice Exercises
Today, you will work with three datasets to apply what you've learned. Each dataset is designed for specific practices:

### Dataset 1: Sales Data (`Dataset1.csv`)
- **Description**: Contains sales data with columns like `Region`, `Sales`, `Profit`, and `Quantity`.
- **Practices**: Practice 1, Practice 2.

### Dataset 2: Customer Feedback Data (`Dataset2.csv`)
- **Description**: Contains customer feedback scores and demographic information.
- **Practices**: Practice 3, Practice 4.

### Dataset 3: Product Performance Data (`Dataset3.csv`)
- **Description**: Contains product performance metrics like `Price`, `Sales`, and `Customer Rating`.
- **Practices**: Practice 5, Practice 6.
