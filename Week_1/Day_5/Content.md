# Day 5 Content: Intermediate SQL Queries

## Overview
Intermediate SQL builds on the basics by introducing powerful techniques for combining and summarizing data. This guide will cover:
1. Joining tables.
2. Aggregating data with GROUP BY.
3. Using HAVING for filtered aggregations.

By the end of the day, youâ€™ll be able to write complex SQL queries to analyze data from multiple tables.

### 1. Joining Tables
JOINs combine data from two or more tables based on a related column.

#### Types of JOINs
- **INNER JOIN**: Returns only matching rows.
- **LEFT JOIN**: Returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table.
- **RIGHT JOIN**: Returns all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table.
- **FULL OUTER JOIN**: Returns all rows from both tables.

#### Example
Combine `Casino_Gaming_Data` and `Quality_of_Life` to include country-related metrics:
SELECT g.`Licensee`, g.`Total Gross Gaming Revenue`, q.`Quality of Life Value`
FROM `Casino_Gaming_Data` g
INNER JOIN `Quality_of_Life` q
ON g.`country_code` = q.`country`;

### 2. Aggregating Data with GROUP BY
GROUP BY groups rows into categories and applies aggregate functions.

#### Aggregate Functions
- `SUM`: Adds numeric values.
- `AVG`: Calculates the average.
- `COUNT`: Counts rows.
- `MAX`/`MIN`: Finds the highest/lowest value.

#### Example
Calculate total `Wagers` per `Fiscal Year`:
SELECT `Fiscal Year`, SUM(`Wagers`) AS Total_Wagers
FROM `Casino_Gaming_Data`
GROUP BY `Fiscal Year`;

---

### 3. Filtering Aggregations with HAVING
HAVING applies filters to grouped data.

#### Example
Filter results to show years with total `Wagers` greater than 300,000:
SELECT `Fiscal Year`, SUM(`Wagers`) AS Total_Wagers
FROM `Casino_Gaming_Data`
GROUP BY `Fiscal Year`
HAVING Total_Wagers > 300000;

### Bonus Learning
Explore these additional SQL concepts:
1. **Subqueries**:
   - Use queries inside another query.
   - Example:
     SELECT `Licensee`, `Total Gross Gaming Revenue`
     FROM `Casino_Gaming_Data`
     WHERE `Total Gross Gaming Revenue` > 
         (SELECT AVG(`Total Gross Gaming Revenue`) 
          FROM `Casino_Gaming_Data`);
2. **Window Functions**:
   - Perform calculations across a specific range of rows.

### Practice Example
Dataset: `Casino_Gaming_Data new.csv`
Task:
1. Join the dataset with `Quality_of_Life.csv` to include country-level metrics.
2. Calculate average `Wagers` for each `Fiscal Year` and filter for years with an average above 100,000.
3. Save the results as a query file.
