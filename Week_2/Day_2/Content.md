### 2.1 Formatting Axes
Axes provide context to your charts, making it crucial to format them correctly.

#### Steps:

2. Adjust the following:
   - **Axis Title**: Add meaningful labels (e.g., "Months" for the x-axis, "Sales" for the y-axis).
   - **Scale**: Modify the minimum and maximum values to focus on relevant data ranges.
   - **Tick Marks**: Choose major or minor tick marks for better granularity.

### 2.2 Adding Data Labels
Data labels provide precise numerical values on your chart.

#### Steps:
1. Click on your chart to activate it.
2. Go to **Chart Tools** > **Add Data Labels**.
3. Customize the data labels:
   - Position: Place them above, inside, or outside the data points.

### 2.3 Using Themes and Colors
Consistent colors and themes improve readability and align charts with your organization's branding.

#### Steps:
1. Go to **Page Layout** > **Themes**.

### 2.4 Creating Combination Charts
Combination charts allow you to visualize multiple data series with different chart types.

#### Example:
Visualize `Total Sales` and `Profit Margin` using a bar and line chart on the same graph.

#### Steps:
1. Highlight the data for `Region`, `Total Sales`, and `Profit Margin`.
2. Go to **Insert** > **Combo Chart** > **Custom Combination Chart**.
3. Assign:
   - Bar chart for `Total Sales`.
   - Line chart for `Profit Margin`.
4. Customize:
   - Add a secondary y-axis for `Profit Margin`.
   - Label both axes clearly.

### 2.5 Adding Annotations
Annotations help draw attention to specific data points.

#### Steps:
1. Select the chart area.
2. Go to **Insert** > **Shapes** and choose an arrow, text box, or circle.
3. Place the annotation on key data points and explain their significance.
