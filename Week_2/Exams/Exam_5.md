# Exam 5: Customizing Visualizations in Python

## Objective
Enhance Python plots with customization.

### Task
1. Use the dataset: `marketing_data.csv`.
2. Create the following:
   - A bar chart showing total "Clicks" by "Ad Campaign", sorted by descending order.
   - A scatter plot with trend lines showing the relationship between "Ad Spend" and "Sales".
   - Annotate key points on the scatter plot (e.g., highest and lowest sales).

### Deliverables
- Python script: `Exam_5_Script.py`.
- Plot images: `Exam_5_CustomPlots.png`.

### Evaluation Criteria
- Effectiveness of customizations (e.g., annotations, themes).
- Accuracy of trend lines.
- Visual appeal of plots.
