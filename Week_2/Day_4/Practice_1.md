# Practice 1: Create Subplots with Multiple Charts

## Task
1. Use the `Adidas_Sales_Data.csv` dataset.
2. Write a Python script to:
   - Create a subplot with:
     - A bar chart showing `Total Sales` by `Region`.
     - A line chart showing `Total Sales` trends over `Months`.
   - Customize each chart:
     - Add titles, axis labels, and gridlines.
     - Use distinct colors for the bars and line.
3. Save the combined figure as "Practice1_Subplots.png".

---

## Deliverable
Submit the Python script as "Practice1_Script.py" and the subplot image as "Practice1_Subplots.png".
