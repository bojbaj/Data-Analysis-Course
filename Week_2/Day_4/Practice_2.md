# Practice 2: Create a Seaborn Heatmap

## Task
1. Use the `Adidas_Sales_Data.csv` dataset.
2. Write a Python script to:
   - Create a pivot table of `Total Sales` with `Month` as rows and `Region` as columns.
   - Generate a heatmap from the pivot table using Seaborn.
   - Add annotations to display the sales values on the heatmap.
   - Use a colormap, such as `coolwarm` or `viridis`.
3. Save the heatmap as "Practice2_Heatmap.png".

---

## Deliverable
Submit the Python script as "Practice2_Script.py" and the heatmap image as "Practice2_Heatmap.png".
