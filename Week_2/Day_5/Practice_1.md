   - Create a dashboard with the following charts:
     - Bar chart: `Total Sales` by `Region`.
     - Line chart: `Monthly Sales Trend`.
     - Scatter plot: Relationship between `Profit Margin` and `Total Sales`.
     - Box plot: Distribution of `Profit Margin` by `Region`.
   - Organize these charts into a 2x2 grid using subplots.
   - Add titles, axis labels, and gridlines for each chart.
3. Save the dashboard as "Practice1_Dashboard.png".
