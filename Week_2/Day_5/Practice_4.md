# Practice 4: Build a Heatmap with Annotations Using Seaborn

## Task
1. Use the `Adidas_Sales_Data.csv` dataset.
2. Write a Python script to:
   - Create a pivot table with `Month` as rows, `Region` as columns, and `Total Sales` as values.
   - Generate a heatmap from the pivot table using Seaborn.
   - Annotate the heatmap with sales values.
   - Use the `coolwarm` colormap.
3. Save the heatmap as "Practice4_Heatmap.png".

---

## Deliverable
Submit the Python script as "Practice4_Script.py" and the heatmap image as "Practice4_Heatmap.png".
