# Day 5: Crafting Data Narratives with Effective Visualizations

## Overview
Today's focus is on creating compelling data narratives through visualizations. You'll learn how to design dashboards, annotate key insights, and build interactive visualizations that engage your audience.

---

## Objectives
- Understand the principles of storytelling with data.
- Create dashboards with multiple charts using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Build interactive visualizations using Plotly.
- Highlight key insights with annotations.

---

## Tasks
1. Read **Content.md** to understand data storytelling techniques.
2. Complete **Practice1.md** through **Practice6.md** to apply what you've learned.
3. Use the dataset provided to build visualizations and dashboards.

---

## Practices
1. **Practice 1**: Create a dashboard with multiple charts using Matplotlib.
2. **Practice 2**: Highlight insights with annotations.
3. **Practice 3**: Create an interactive scatter plot with Plotly.
4. **Practice 4**: Build a heatmap with annotations using Seaborn.
5. **Practice 5**: Combine Seaborn and Matplotlib for advanced dashboards.
6. **Practice 6**: Save a complete dashboard as a report-ready image.

---

## Deliverables
- Python scripts: `Practice1_Script.py` to `Practice6_Script.py`.
- Image files for dashboards and charts: `Practice1_Dashboard.png` to `Practice6_Report_Dashboard.png`.
