## 1. Key Topics to Review
### 1.1 Principles of Effective Data Visualization
- **Clarity**: Use clear labels, titles, and clean layouts.
- **Relevance**: Select the appropriate chart type for your data.
- **Focus**: Highlight key insights with annotations and colors.

### 1.2 Visualization Techniques
1. **Excel**:
   - Creating bar, line, and combination charts.
   - Advanced formatting (conditional formatting, themes, and annotations).
2. **Python**:
   - Using Matplotlib for static visualizations.
   - Leveraging Seaborn for heatmaps, pair plots, and box plots.
   - Building interactive visualizations with Plotly.
3. **Dashboards**:
   - Combining multiple charts into a cohesive view.
   - Using annotations and grid layouts for professional presentations.

## 2. Practice Example: Mock Analysis
### Scenario:
A retail company wants insights into sales trends, product performance, and profitability across regions.

### Tasks:
1. **Clean the Dataset**:
   - Handle missing or inconsistent data.
   - Group data by `Region` and `Category` for analysis.
2. **Create Visualizations**:
   - Heatmap: `Total Sales` by `Month` and `Region`.
   - Line Chart: `Profit Margin` trends over time.
   - Bar Chart: `Total Sales` by `Category` and `Region`.
3. **Deliver Insights**:
   - Highlight the highest-performing region and product category.
   - Identify opportunities for improvement.
