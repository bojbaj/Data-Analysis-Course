# Practice 6: Identify Errors and Correct Them

## Task
1. Use the `Adidas_Sales_Data.csv` dataset to create a bar chart showing `Total Sales` by `Region`.
2. Simulate and fix the following issues:
   - **Incorrect Axis Labels**: Ensure the x-axis is labeled "Region" and the y-axis is labeled "Total Sales".
   - **Missing Title**: Add a meaningful title: "Total Sales by Region".
   - **Data Labels**: Ensure data labels are added for clarity.
   - **Misleading Colors**: Ensure colors are consistent and not overly distracting.
3. Save your corrected chart as "Practice6_Corrected_Chart.xlsx".
