## Task
1. Use the `Adidas_Sales_Data.csv` dataset.
2. Write a Python script to:
   - Check for missing or inconsistent data.
   - Replace missing values with the mean or a default value.
   - Group the data by `Region` and calculate the total and average `Profit Margin`.
3. Save the cleaned dataset as "Practice1_Cleaned_Data.csv".

---

## Deliverable
Submit the Python script as "Practice1_Script.py" and the cleaned dataset as "Practice1_Cleaned_Data.csv".
