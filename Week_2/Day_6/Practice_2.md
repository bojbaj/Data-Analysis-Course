2. Write a Python script to:
   - Create a heatmap of `Total Sales` by `Region` and `Month` using Seaborn.
   - Annotate the heatmap with sales values.
   - Use a colormap, such as `coolwarm` or `magma`.
3. Save the heatmap as "Practice2_Heatmap.png".

---

## Deliverable
Submit the Python script as "Practice2_Script.py" and the heatmap image as "Practice2_Heatmap.png".
