# Day 5 Content: Advanced Data Analysis with SQL

## Overview
Today, we focus on advanced data analysis techniques using SQL. You will learn how to write complex queries to analyze datasets, perform aggregations, and extract meaningful insights. By the end of the day, you will be able to use SQL to solve real-world data analysis problems.

## 1. Why Use SQL for Data Analysis?
SQL is a powerful tool for data analysis because it allows you to:
- Perform complex queries on large datasets efficiently.
- Aggregate and summarize data using functions like `SUM`, `AVG`, and `COUNT`.
- Combine data from multiple tables using joins.
- Filter and sort data to focus on specific insights.

## 2. Aggregating Data in SQL
Aggregation functions summarize data and provide insights into trends and patterns. Common aggregation functions include:

### 2.1 Summing Data
- Use the `SUM()` function to calculate the total of a numeric column.
- Example: Calculate the total sales for each region.

### 2.2 Averaging Data
- Use the `AVG()` function to calculate the average of a numeric column.
- Example: Calculate the average price of products.

### 2.3 Counting Data
- Use the `COUNT()` function to count the number of rows in a dataset.
- Example: Count the number of transactions for each customer.

## 3. Grouping Data in SQL
Grouping data allows you to summarize data by specific categories. Techniques include:

### 3.1 Using GROUP BY
- Use the `GROUP BY` clause to group rows based on one or more columns.
- Example: Group sales data by region and calculate total sales for each region.

### 3.2 Filtering Grouped Data
- Use the `HAVING` clause to filter grouped data based on conditions.
- Example: Filter regions with total sales greater than $10,000.

## 4. Combining Data with Joins
SQL joins allow you to combine data from multiple tables. Techniques include:

### 4.1 Inner Join
- Combine rows from two tables where the join condition is met.
- Example: Combine customer data with transaction data using the `Customer ID` column.

### 4.2 Left Join
- Include all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table.
- Example: Include all customers, even if they have no transactions.

---

## 5. Subqueries and Nested Queries
Subqueries allow you to perform complex queries by nesting one query inside another. Techniques include:

### 5.1 Using Subqueries in WHERE Clauses
- Use subqueries to filter data based on conditions from another query.
- Example: Find customers who made purchases above the average transaction value.

### 5.2 Using Subqueries in SELECT Clauses
- Use subqueries to calculate derived columns.
- Example: Calculate the percentage of total sales for each region.

## 6. Practice Exercises
Use the provided datasets to complete the following tasks:
- Practice 1: Calculate total sales by region.
- Practice 2: Find the average price of products.
- Practice 3: Count the number of transactions for each customer.
- Practice 4: Group sales data by region and filter regions with high sales.
- Practice 5: Combine customer and transaction data using joins.
- Practice 6: Use subqueries to find customers with above-average spending.
