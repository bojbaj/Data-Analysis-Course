# Day 6: Data Visualization with Python

## Overview
Today, we focus on data visualization techniques using Python. You will learn how to create various types of charts and graphs to represent data visually. By the end of the day, you will be able to use Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create insightful visualizations.

---

## Objectives
- Learn how to create basic and advanced charts using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Customize visualizations with titles, labels, and colors.
- Save visualizations as image files for reports and presentations.

---

## Tasks
1. Read **Content.md** for a comprehensive introduction to Python data visualization.
2. Complete **Practice1.md** through **Practice6.md** to apply what you've learned.
3. Use the provided datasets to create visualizations.

---

## Deliverables
- Submit visualization files for each practice task.
- Save your files as:
  - "Practice1_Bar_Chart.png"
  - "Practice2_Line_Chart.png"
  - "Practice3_Scatter_Plot.png"
  - "Practice4_Heatmap.png"
  - "Practice5_Box_Plot.png"
  - "Practice6_Pair_Plot.png"
