# Practice 5: Identifying and Correcting Outliers in Excel

## Task:
Using **Dataset3.csv** (Customer data), identify any outliers in the 'Age' column. An outlier is defined as any value that is more than 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR) above the third quartile or below the first quartile.

Steps:
1. Calculate the IQR for the 'Age' column.
2. Identify the outliers and replace them with the mean age value.

## Expected Outcome:
- Outliers in the 'Age' column should be replaced with the mean age.
