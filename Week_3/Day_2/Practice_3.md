# Practice 3: Data Normalization in Python

## Task:
Using **Dataset3.csv** (Customer data), normalize the 'Age' column values to a range of 0 to 1 using the following formula:
normalized_age = (age - min(age)) / (max(age) - min(age))

## Expected Outcome:
- You should have a new column in the dataset called 'Normalized_Age' with the normalized age values.
