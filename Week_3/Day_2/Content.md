## 1. Advanced Excel Functions for Data Cleaning
Excel provides several functions to clean and transform data. Key functions include:

### 1.1 Text Functions
- **TRIM**: Removes extra spaces from text.
- **LEFT/RIGHT/MID**: Extracts specific parts of a text string.
- **CONCATENATE**: Combines text from multiple cells.

### 1.2 Logical Functions
- **IF**: Performs conditional checks.
- **IFERROR**: Handles errors in formulas.

### 1.3 Lookup Functions
- **VLOOKUP**: Searches for a value in a table.
- **INDEX-MATCH**: A more flexible alternative to VLOOKUP.

## 2. Conditional Formatting for Identifying Issues
Conditional formatting helps highlight errors, outliers, and inconsistencies in datasets. Common uses include:
- Highlighting duplicate values.
- Identifying missing or blank cells.
- Flagging values outside a specified range.

## 3. Data Validation for Ensuring Data Integrity
Data validation ensures that data entered into a worksheet meets specific criteria. Techniques include:
- Restricting input to a specific range (e.g., numbers between 0 and 100).
- Creating dropdown lists for consistent data entry.
- Preventing duplicate entries.

## 4. Handling Large Datasets
Excel can handle large datasets, but performance can be improved by:
- Using **Tables** for structured data.
- Applying **Filters** to focus on specific subsets of data.
- Using **Power Query** for advanced data transformation.
