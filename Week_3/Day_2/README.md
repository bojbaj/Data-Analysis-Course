# Day 2: Data Cleaning and Transformation (Continued)

## Overview
In today's session, we will continue learning about Data Cleaning and Transformation techniques. This day focuses on:
- Handling missing values
- Identifying and correcting inconsistencies in data
- Data normalization and standardization
- Using Excel, SQL, and Python for cleaning and transformation tasks

This day includes theoretical knowledge and practical exercises, with an emphasis on Excel and SQL, followed by Python.

## Key Topics
1. **Handling Missing Data**
   - Understanding missing data
   - Techniques to deal with missing data (Imputation, Removal)
   
2. **Data Inconsistencies**
   - Identifying outliers
   - Dealing with inconsistent data entries
   
3. **Data Normalization and Standardization**
   - Differences between normalization and standardization
   - Methods to apply both techniques

4. **Data Transformation Using Excel**
   - Using Excel functions for data cleaning
   - Conditional formatting for identifying anomalies
   
5. **Data Transformation Using SQL**
   - SQL queries for cleaning data (UPDATE, DELETE, etc.)
   - Aggregation techniques
   
6. **Python Data Transformation**
   - Using Python libraries for data cleaning (Pandas, Numpy)

## Datasets
The datasets for todayâ€™s session are the following:
- **Dataset1.csv**: Contains sales data with missing values and anomalies.
- **Dataset2.csv**: Contains product data with inconsistencies in product names and prices.
- **Dataset3.csv**: A customer data set with outliers in the age column.
