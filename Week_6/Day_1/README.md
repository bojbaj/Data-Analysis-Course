# Day 1: Advanced Interactive Visualizations with Plotly and Dash

## Overview
Today, we dive into creating advanced interactive visualizations using **Plotly** and **Dash**, a Python framework for building web-based dashboards. You will learn how to create dynamic, interactive dashboards that can be used to explore and present data in real-time. By the end of the day, you will be able to build and deploy interactive dashboards for data analysis and reporting.

---

## Objectives
- Learn the basics of Dash and its integration with Plotly.
- Create interactive dashboards with multiple components (e.g., dropdowns, sliders, graphs).
- Deploy a simple dashboard for real-time data exploration.

---

## Tasks
1. Read **Content.md** for a comprehensive introduction to Dash and interactive visualizations.
2. Complete **Practice1.md** through **Practice6.md** to apply what you've learned.
3. Use the provided datasets to create interactive dashboards.

---

## Deliverables
- Submit interactive dashboards for each practice task.
- Save your files as:
  - "Practice1_Dashboard.html"
  - "Practice2_Dashboard.html"
  - "Practice3_Dashboard.html"
  - "Practice4_Dashboard.html"
  - "Practice5_Dashboard.html"
  - "Practice6_Dashboard.html"
