# Day 5: Advanced Statistical Techniques

## Overview
Today, we dive into advanced statistical techniques, including **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)** and **Time Series Analysis**. These techniques are essential for analyzing complex datasets and uncovering deeper insights. By the end of the day, you will be able to apply these methods to real-world data and interpret the results.
