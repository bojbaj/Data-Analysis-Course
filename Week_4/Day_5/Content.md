# Day 5 Content: Advanced Statistical Techniques

## Overview
Today, we focus on two advanced statistical techniques: **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)** and **Time Series Analysis**. These methods are widely used in data analysis to compare groups and analyze trends over time. By the end of the day, you will be able to apply these techniques to real-world datasets and interpret the results.

## 1. What is ANOVA?
ANOVA is a statistical method used to compare the means of three or more groups. It helps determine whether there are statistically significant differences between the groups.

### 1.1 Types of ANOVA
- **One-Way ANOVA**: Compares the means of one independent variable with three or more groups.
- **Two-Way ANOVA**: Compares the means of two independent variables.

### 1.2 Key Concepts
- **F-statistic**: Measures the ratio of between-group variance to within-group variance.
- **p-value**: Determines the statistical significance of the results.
- **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: Assumes no difference between group means.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**: Assumes at least one group mean is different.

### 1.3 Applications of ANOVA
- Comparing sales performance across regions.
- Analyzing the impact of different marketing strategies.
- Testing the effectiveness of multiple treatments in healthcare.

## 2. What is Time Series Analysis?
Time series analysis is used to analyze data points collected over time. It helps identify trends, seasonal patterns, and forecast future values.

### 2.1 Components of Time Series
- **Trend**: The long-term movement in the data.
- **Seasonality**: Regular patterns that repeat over a fixed period.
- **Noise**: Random fluctuations in the data.

### 2.2 Techniques in Time Series Analysis
- **Moving Averages**: Smooth out short-term fluctuations to highlight trends.
- **Decomposition**: Break down the time series into trend, seasonality, and noise.
- **Forecasting**: Predict future values using models like ARIMA or Exponential Smoothing.

### 2.3 Applications of Time Series Analysis
- Forecasting sales or revenue.
- Analyzing stock market trends.
- Predicting website traffic or user engagement.

## 3. Practice Exercises
Today, you will work with three datasets to apply what you've learned. Each dataset is designed for specific practices:

### Dataset 1: Sales Data by Region (`Dataset1.csv`)
- **Description**: Contains sales data for three regions (North, South, East) over 12 months.
- **Practices**: Practice 1, Practice 3.

### Dataset 2: Monthly Website Traffic (`Dataset2.csv`)
- **Description**: Contains monthly website traffic data for two years.
- **Practices**: Practice 2, Practice 4.

### Dataset 3: Product Sales Over Time (`Dataset3.csv`)
- **Description**: Contains product sales data over 24 months, including price and promotions.
- **Practices**: Practice 5, Practice 6.

## 4. Practice Tasks
### Practice 1: Performing One-Way ANOVA
- **Dataset**: `Dataset1.csv`
- **Task**: Perform a one-way ANOVA to compare sales across regions.

### Practice 2: Analyzing Website Traffic Trends
- **Dataset**: `Dataset2.csv`
- **Task**: Analyze the trend and seasonality in website traffic.

### Practice 3: Comparing Group Means with ANOVA
- **Dataset**: `Dataset1.csv`
- **Task**: Compare the means of sales across regions and interpret the results.

### Practice 4: Forecasting Website Traffic
- **Dataset**: `Dataset2.csv`
- **Task**: Forecast website traffic for the next 6 months using time series analysis.

### Practice 5: Advanced Analysis of Product Sales
- **Dataset**: `Dataset3.csv`
- **Task**: Analyze the impact of price and promotions on product sales.

### Practice 6: Creating a Final Report
- **Dataset**: `Dataset3.csv`
- **Task**: Create a comprehensive report summarizing your findings from the analysis.
