# Day 6 Content: Case Study and Real-World Application

## Overview
Today, you will apply all the statistical techniques youâ€™ve learned this week to a real-world dataset. You will analyze the data, draw actionable insights, and create a comprehensive report summarizing your findings. This case study will simulate a real-world business scenario, allowing you to practice solving problems like a professional data analyst.

## 1. What is a Case Study?
A case study is an in-depth analysis of a real-world scenario using data. It involves:
- Identifying the problem or question.
- Analyzing the data using statistical techniques.
- Drawing actionable insights and making recommendations.

### Why are Case Studies Important?
- They help you apply theoretical knowledge to real-world problems.
- They demonstrate your ability to analyze data and communicate insights.
- They are often used in job interviews and professional settings to showcase your skills.

## 2. Steps to Conduct a Case Study
### 2.1 Define the Problem
- Clearly state the problem or question you are trying to solve.
- Example: "How can we improve sales performance in underperforming regions?"

### 2.2 Analyze the Data
- Use descriptive and inferential statistics to analyze the data.
- Identify trends, patterns, and outliers.

### 2.3 Draw Insights
- Interpret the results of your analysis.
- Identify actionable insights that can help solve the problem.

### 2.4 Create a Report
- Summarize your findings in a professional report.
- Include visualizations, key insights, and recommendations.

## 3. Datasets for Today
Today, you will work with three datasets to apply what you've learned. Each dataset is designed for specific practices:

### Dataset 1: Sales Performance Data (`Dataset1.csv`)
- **Description**: Contains sales data with columns like `Region`, `Sales`, `Profit`, and `Quantity`.
- **Practices**: Practice 1, Practice 2.

### Dataset 2: Customer Satisfaction Data (`Dataset2.csv`)
- **Description**: Contains customer satisfaction scores and demographic information.
- **Practices**: Practice 3, Practice 4.

### Dataset 3: Marketing Campaign Data (`Dataset3.csv`)
- **Description**: Contains data on marketing campaigns, including `CampaignID`, `Cost`, `Revenue`, and `ROI`.
- **Practices**: Practice 5, Practice 6.

## 4. Practice Tasks
### Practice 1: Analyzing Sales Performance
- **Dataset**: `Dataset1.csv`
- **Task**: Analyze the sales performance across regions. Calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation of `Sales` and `Profit`.

### Practice 2: Identifying Underperforming Regions
- **Dataset**: `Dataset1.csv`
- **Task**: Identify regions with below-average sales and profit. Use descriptive statistics to summarize the findings.

### Practice 3: Analyzing Customer Satisfaction
- **Dataset**: `Dataset2.csv`
- **Task**: Analyze customer satisfaction scores across different demographic groups. Calculate the mean and standard deviation of `SatisfactionScore`.

### Practice 4: Identifying Key Drivers of Satisfaction
- **Dataset**: `Dataset2.csv`
- **Task**: Identify the key drivers of customer satisfaction. Use correlation analysis to find relationships between `SatisfactionScore` and other variables.

### Practice 5: Evaluating Marketing Campaigns
- **Dataset**: `Dataset3.csv`
- **Task**: Evaluate the performance of marketing campaigns. Calculate the ROI for each campaign and identify the most effective campaigns.

### Practice 6: Creating a Case Study Report
- **Dataset**: `Dataset3.csv`
- **Task**: Create a comprehensive case study report summarizing your findings from Practices 1-5. Include visualizations, key insights, and recommendations.
