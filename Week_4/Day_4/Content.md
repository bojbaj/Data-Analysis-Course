## 2. Principles of Effective Data Visualization
Effective visualizations are:
- **Clear**: Easy to understand at a glance.
- **Relevant**: Focused on the key message.
- **Accurate**: Represent the data truthfully.
- **Engaging**: Visually appealing and professional.

### Common Visualization Types
1. **Bar Charts**: Compare categories.
2. **Line Charts**: Show trends over time.
3. **Pie Charts**: Show proportions.
4. **Heatmaps**: Show data intensity.
5. **Scatter Plots**: Show relationships between variables.

## 4. Practice Exercises
Today, you will work with three datasets to apply what you've learned. Each dataset is designed for specific practices:

### Dataset 1: Sales Data (`Dataset1.csv`)
- **Description**: Contains sales data with columns like `Region`, `Sales`, `Profit`, and `Quantity`.
- **Practices**: Practice 1, Practice 2.

### Dataset 2: Customer Feedback Data (`Dataset2.csv`)
- **Description**: Contains customer feedback scores and demographic information.
- **Practices**: Practice 3, Practice 4.

### Dataset 3: Product Performance Data (`Dataset3.csv`)
- **Description**: Contains product performance metrics like `Price`, `Sales`, and `Customer Rating`.
- **Practices**: Practice 5, Practice 6.

## 5. Practice Tasks
### Practice 1: Creating a Sales Report
- **Dataset**: `Dataset1.csv`
- **Task**: Create a report summarizing sales by region, including a bar chart and a table of key metrics.

### Practice 2: Visualizing Sales Trends
- **Dataset**: `Dataset1.csv`
- **Task**: Create a line chart showing monthly sales trends.

### Practice 3: Creating a Customer Feedback Report
- **Dataset**: `Dataset2.csv`
- **Task**: Create a report summarizing customer feedback scores by demographic, including a pie chart.

### Practice 4: Visualizing Feedback Scores
- **Dataset**: `Dataset2.csv`
- **Task**: Create a heatmap showing feedback scores by region and age group.

### Practice 5: Creating a Product Performance Report
- **Dataset**: `Dataset3.csv`
- **Task**: Create a report summarizing product performance, including a scatter plot of `Price` vs. `Sales`.

### Practice 6: Visualizing Customer Ratings
- **Dataset**: `Dataset3.csv`
