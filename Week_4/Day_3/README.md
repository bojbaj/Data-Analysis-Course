# Day 3: Correlation and Regression Analysis

## Overview
Today, we dive into **correlation and regression analysis**, two powerful statistical techniques used to understand relationships between variables. You will learn how to calculate correlation coefficients, perform linear regression, and interpret the results. By the end of the day, you will be able to analyze relationships in datasets and make predictions using regression models.
