# Day 2: Inferential Statistics and Hypothesis Testing

## Overview
Today, we dive into **inferential statistics** and **hypothesis testing**. You will learn how to draw conclusions about a population based on sample data and validate your findings using statistical tests like **t-tests** and **chi-square tests**. By the end of the day, you will be able to perform hypothesis testing and interpret the results.

## Objectives
- Understand the basics of inferential statistics.
- Learn how to formulate and test hypotheses.
- Perform t-tests and chi-square tests to validate data insights.

---

## Tasks
1. Read **Content.md** for a comprehensive introduction to inferential statistics and hypothesis testing.
2. Complete **Practice1.md** through **Practice6.md** to apply what you've learned.
3. Use the provided datasets to perform hypothesis testing tasks.

---

## Deliverables
