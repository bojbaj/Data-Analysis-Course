# Day 7 Content: Weekly Review and Final Examination

## Overview
Today, you will consolidate your knowledge of **statistical analysis** and **reporting** by completing a series of tasks designed to simulate real-world scenarios. The examination is divided into three levels: **Easy**, **Medium**, and **Hard**. Each level builds on the previous one, testing your ability to apply statistical techniques and create professional reports.

---

## 1. Key Topics to Review
### 1.1 Descriptive Statistics
- **Measures of Central Tendency**: Mean, median, mode.
- **Measures of Dispersion**: Variance, standard deviation.

### 1.2 Inferential Statistics
- **Hypothesis Testing**: t-tests, chi-square tests.
- **Correlation and Regression**: Understanding relationships between variables.

### 1.3 Data Reporting
- **Effective Visualization**: Choosing the right chart for the data.
- **Storytelling with Data**: Presenting insights in a clear and compelling way.

## 2. Examination Structure
The examination consists of six tasks, divided into three levels of difficulty:

### 2.1 Easy Level
- **Task 1**: Calculate descriptive statistics for a dataset.
- **Task 2**: Create a basic visualization (e.g., bar chart, line chart).

### 2.2 Medium Level
- **Task 3**: Perform hypothesis testing on a dataset.
- **Task 4**: Create a professional report summarizing your findings.

### 2.3 Hard Level
- **Task 5**: Conduct advanced statistical analysis (e.g., ANOVA, time series analysis).
- **Task 6**: Create a final report with actionable insights for stakeholders.

## 3. Datasets for Today
You will work with three datasets, each designed for specific tasks:

### Dataset 1: Sales Data (`Dataset1.csv`)
- **Description**: Contains sales data with columns like `Region`, `Sales`, `Profit`, and `Quantity`.
- **Practices**: Practice 1, Practice 2.

### Dataset 2: Customer Feedback Data (`Dataset2.csv`)
- **Description**: Contains customer feedback scores and demographic information.
- **Practices**: Practice 3, Practice 4.

### Dataset 3: Product Performance Data (`Dataset3.csv`)
- **Description**: Contains product performance metrics like `Price`, `Sales`, and `Customer Rating`.
- **Practices**: Practice 5, Practice 6.
